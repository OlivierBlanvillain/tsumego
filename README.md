What the hell?
==============

First, I am sorry. This project is the biggest mess. If you want to learn best
practices, just look here and do everything differently!

A bit of history
----------------

When I created [Tsumego Collections](http://tsumego.tasuki.org/) in 2004, I was
young and naive. Also didn't understand the importance of writing maintainable
code. As a result, this was mostly created by copying few scripts around and
modifying each of them to fit the particular sgf/tex files.

Get it running
---------------------

As of 2018 I can get it running on Ubuntu with `texlive`, `sgf2dg`, and Kashomon's [go-type1](https://github.com/Kashomon/go-type1).

	cd books
	make

Thanks
------

I would never get anywhere without Toxygen's immense help with converting the
original Metafont fonts into Type1. For that I am eternally grateful!
