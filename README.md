What the fuck?
==============

First, I am sorry. This project is the biggest mess. Feel free to play around
with it, but bear in mind that **making this work will likely require
nontrivial amount of effort**.

Feel free to fork. Or rather create a new project altogether. I am deeply
convinced this can no longer be beaten into reasonable shape.

A bit of history
----------------

When I created [Tsumego Collections](http://tsumego.tasuki.org/) in 2004, I was
young and naive. Also didn't understand the importance of writing maintainable
code. As a result, this was mostly created by copying few scripts around and
modifying each of them to fit the particular sgf/tex files.

What's included?
----------------

* books -- Contains the .tex files from which the pdf's were produced.
* fonts -- Type1 fonts; Metafont fonts look ugly as hell in pdf cause they're
  bitmaps.
* macros -- The two macro files from sgf2dg that you will definitely need. For
  further reference, [google sgf2dg](http://www.google.com/?q=sgf2dg).
* scripts -- Scripts I wrote when creating the pdf's. Might have been
  customized for each book.

Is that enough to get it running? I don't know.

Thanks
------

I would never get anywhere without Toxygen's immense help with converting the
original Metafont fonts into Type1. For that I am eternally grateful!
